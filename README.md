# Payout proof upload service

This service deals with generating presigned S3 object to enable temporarily access to PUT/GET object from Amazon S3 for payout.
Using TypeScript only for fun. ðŸ˜Š

## Setup

Ensure that the following environmental variables are present. The access key must have read and write permission to an S3 bucket.

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_KEY
S3_BUCKET_REGION
S3_BUCKET_NAME
LAMBDA_REGION
LAMBDA_FUNC_NAME

The code that exists on `lambda` folder must be uploaded to Lambda (include `node_modules`) - it only have one dependency `node-fetch` to keep the bundle tiny.

The `express` routes are just for testing and triggering the file upload and lambda function execution.


## What it does

Reminder: Lambda **request body** has 5MB and it should be used to handle data, not file. But it does not stop us from exploiting `aws-sdk` to retrieve S3 binary data via code as long as the file does not eat up the whole Lambda allocated memory.

This service:

* Allows user to get presigned url to PUT object in S3
* User can then upload the file directly to S3. (Client has the choice and flexibility to do PUT request).
* Since we know the S3 bucketKey, we can trigger the lambda to upload the file via Salesforce Native API to a specific loan object id.

It's a two step process - use this to understand and explore option.

The most important bit is the upload how to upload to Salesforce - so please take a look at the `uploadToSF` lambda function and understand the multi-part request concept so that you can build and replicate this into any other language of your choice.
